## Palindrome Number

`Read the same from backward and forward`
x = 121 ->>> output: true

## Fibonacci Series

`0, 1 the third number will be sum of previous two numbers`
`F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1`
`F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1`
Series -> 0 , 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
n = 3 ->>> output: 2

## Valid Anagram

`Anagram form with rearranging the letter of words, using all original letters`

s = "anagram" t = "nagaram" ->>> true
s = "rat" t = "cat" ->>> false

## Two sum

num = [2,7,11,15] target = 9

output = [0,1] (Because num[0] + num[1] = 9)


## Best Time to by and Sell Stocks

`You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day`.
`You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.`
