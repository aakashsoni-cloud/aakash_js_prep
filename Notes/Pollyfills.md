### The Need for Polyfills
New features: Polyfills enable programmers to use cutting-edge functions of a web platform or programming language in older browsers or environments that don't support them.

Browser Compatibility: The latest features of a programming language or web platform may not be supported by all browsers and environments, which can cause compatibility problems for developers. Polyfills aid in ensuring that the code functions consistently on various browsers and gadgets.

### Benefits of Using Polyfills
Better User Experience: Polyfills allow developers to improve user experience by adding features and capabilities, even in older browsers.

Reduced development time: By enabling developers to use new capabilities without having to write specific code for older browsers, polyfills can save developers a significant amount of effort.

Cost-effective: Using polyfills saves money by preventing the need to design specialised solutions for every browser or device by ensuring that your code works on a variety of browsers and mobile devices.

Enhanced security: Using polyfills can also increase security by offering a different implementation of a feature that might have security flaws in earlier browser versions.

Better cross-browser compatibility: Polyfills enable programmers to use new capabilities of a programming language or web platform in situations or environments that don't support them, ensuring that their code functions reliably across various browsers and devices.

Future-proofing: By incorporating new capabilities that might become standards in upcoming iterations of the programming language or web platform, developers can future-proof their code by utilising polyfills.

Open-source community: Developers can use a variety of open-source polyfill libraries to take use of the skills and knowledge of other developers.

Better accessibility: By offering fallbacks for features that may not be supported by assistive technologies, polyfills can help make web applications more accessible to users with impairments.
